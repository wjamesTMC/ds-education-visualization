# Distributions
#

# Numerical data, that are not categorical, also have distributions. In general,
# when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each entry is not an
# effective summary since most entries are unique. In our case study, while
# several students reported a height of 68 inches, only one student reported a
# height of 68.503937007874 inches and only one student reported a height
# 68.8976377952756 inches. We assume that they converted from 174 and 175
# centimeters respectively.

# Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way to define a distribution
# for numeric data is to define a function that reports the proportion of the
# data below

for all possible values of a. This function is called the cumulative distribution function (CDF). In statistics, the following notation is used:
     
     F
(
     a
)
=
     Pr
(
     x
     â‰¤
     a
)
